ðŸ“š **Terraform Concepts by Level**
ðŸŸ¢ **Basic Concepts**
These are the foundational elements required to write and run Terraform code.

Concept	Description
Providers	Plugins for managing resources (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP)
Resources	Define infrastructure components (e.g., EC2, S3)
Variables	Inputs to parameterize your code
Outputs	Return values after terraform apply
Terraform CLI Commands	init, plan, apply, destroy, validate, fmt
State File (.tfstate)	Keeps track of created resources
Basic File Structure	main.tf, variables.tf, outputs.tf, terraform.tfvars

ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate Concepts**
These concepts improve modularity, reusability, and team collaboration.

Concept	Description
Modules	Reusable Terraform components
Data Sources	Read information from existing infrastructure
Remote Backend	Store state remotely (e.g., AWS S3) with locking (e.g., DynamoDB)
Workspaces	Manage multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod)
Interpolation & Expressions	Use variables and functions inside Terraform code
Terraform Environment Variables	Set config via env variables (e.g., for secrets)
Terraform Files Layout for Multiple Environments	environments/dev/, environments/prod/

ðŸ”´ **Advanced Concepts**
Used in production setups and complex infrastructure provisioning.

Concept	Description
Custom Modules	Build and publish reusable modules (internal or public registry)
Dynamic Blocks	Create flexible resource blocks using loops
For_each & Count	Create multiple resources dynamically
Lifecycle Rules	Control resource behavior (prevent_destroy, create_before_destroy)
Provisioners	Run scripts during create/delete operations (use sparingly)
Dependency Management (depends_on)	Force execution order between resources
Sensitive Data Handling	Secure variables marked as sensitive
Terraform in CI/CD	Automate Terraform in GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Jenkins
Security Scanning	Tools like tflint, tfsec, checkov for code scanning
Complex Templating	Use templatefile() or file() to generate complex configs (e.g., JSON, scripts)
State Management	Importing resources, tainting, refreshing, and moving state manually

ðŸ“Œ **Example Learning Path:**
Start with: Providers â†’ Resources â†’ Variables â†’ Outputs
Learn: Modules â†’ Data â†’ Remote state â†’ Workspaces
Master: For_each â†’ Lifecycle â†’ CI/CD â†’ Security tools
