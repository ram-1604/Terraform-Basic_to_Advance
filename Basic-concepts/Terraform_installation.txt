Manual Installation In Windows 

To install Terraform, find the appropriate package (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) for your system and download it as a zip archive.
After downloading Terraform, unzip the package. Terraform runs as a single binary named terraform. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Terraform will still function.
Finally, make sure that the terraform binary is available on your PATH. This process will differ depending on your operating system.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1618280/where-can-i-set-path-to-make-exe-on-windows contains instructions for setting the PATH on Windows through the user interface.

Verify that the installation worked by opening a new terminal session and listing Terraform's available subcommands.
terraform -version 


Linux:

Ensure that your system is up to date and you have installed the gnupg, software-properties-common, and curl packages installed. You will use these packages to verify HashiCorp's GPG signature and install HashiCorp's Debian package repository.

$ sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y gnupg software-properties-common

Install the HashiCorp GPG key.

$ wget -O- https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com/gpg | \
gpg --dearmor | \
sudo tee /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg > /dev/null

Verify the key's fingerprint.

$ gpg --no-default-keyring \
--keyring /usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg \
--fingerprint

The gpg command will report the key fingerprint:

/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg
-------------------------------------------------
pub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [SC]
AAAA AAAA AAAA AAAA
uid           [ unknown] HashiCorp Security (HashiCorp Package Signing) <security+packaging@hashicorp.com>
sub   rsa4096 XXXX-XX-XX [E]


Refer to the Official Packaging Guide for the latest public signing key. You can also verify the key on Security at HashiCorp under Linux Package Checksum Verification.

Add the official HashiCorp repository to your system. The lsb_release -cs command finds the distribution release codename for your current system, such as buster, groovy, or sid.

$ echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/hashicorp-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.releases.hashicorp.com $(grep -oP '(?<=UBUNTU_CODENAME=).*' /etc/os-release || lsb_release -cs) main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/hashicorp.list

Download the package information from HashiCorp.

$ sudo apt update

Install Terraform from the new repository.

$ sudo apt-get install terraform

Now that you have added the HashiCorp repository, you can install Vault, Consul, Nomad and Packer with the same command.
