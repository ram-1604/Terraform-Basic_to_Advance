Manual Installation In Windows 

To install Terraform, find the appropriate package (https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install) for your system and download it as a zip archive.
After downloading Terraform, unzip the package. Terraform runs as a single binary named terraform. Any other files in the package can be safely removed and Terraform will still function.
Finally, make sure that the terraform binary is available on your PATH. This process will differ depending on your operating system.
